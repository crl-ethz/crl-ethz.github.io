  abstract={Hybrid mobile robots that integrate wheels and legs present a promising locomotion paradigm, combining the speed and efficiency of wheeled motion with the adaptability of legged systems. However, controlling such platforms remains challenging due to their underactuated and hybrid dynamics. This project explores a control-learning framework that leverages trajectory optimization (TO) or model predictive control (MPC) to generate high-quality motion plans while concurrently distilling a lightweight neural policy through supervised learning. The approach supports both sampling-based and gradient-based optimization methods, depending on simulator capabilities, and emphasizes real-world learning by collecting rollout data directly from hardware. The resulting policy enables efficient and robust control suitable for deployment under real-time constraints. Development and evaluation will be conducted using the LIMX Dynamics TRON1 robot, a bipedal wheeled platform with 4 DoF per leg, providing a rich testbed for advancing agile and intelligent control in hybrid robotic systems.},
